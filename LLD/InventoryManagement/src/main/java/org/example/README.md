# Inventory Management System
An Inventory Management System (IMS) is a software solution that helps businesses efficiently track, organize, and control their inventory across the supply chain, from procurement to storage to sales and fulfillment.

## Functional Requirements
- Support basic inventory operations: add new items, update quantities, and remove stock.
- There should be an order management system as well through which users can create orders. Orders will be fulfilled if sufficient inventory is available.
- Maintain stock levels per product, per warehouse. 
- Allow multiple warehouses, each with its own inventory tracking. 
- Enable setting and checking minimum stock thresholds for alerts. 
- Record a history of all inventory transactions, including timestamps and operation types. 
- Support viewing current stock levels by product and by warehouse.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Modularity: The system should follow object-oriented principles with well-separated components. 
- Consistency: Inventory updates should be accurate and reflect immediately across relevant views and reports. 
- Thread-Safety: The system must handle concurrent updates safely, especially when modifying stock quantities. 
- Extensibility: The design should support future enhancements like batch imports, barcoding, or serial number tracking. 
- Auditability: All operations should be logged for traceability and future analysis. 
- Maintainability: The code should be clean, testable, and easy to enhance.
